### Introduction to Node.js

### What is Node.js
- Node.js® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine.
- Node.js is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Google’s V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library.
  
- Node Is Built on Google Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine  

### Getting started
  
  - use a version manager instead. This is a program that allows you to install multiple versions of Node and switch between them at will. 
  - can check that Node is installed on your system by opening a terminal and typing ```node -v```
  - Next, create a new file hello.js and copy in the following code:
- Next, create a new file hello.js and copy in the following code:
  
 - installing globally ``` npm install -g jshint ```
 - installing locally ``` npm init -y```
   
 - Node.js, however, is single-threaded. It’s also event-driven, which means that everything that happens in Node is in reaction to an event.
 
 - When the I/O operation has finished (another kind of event), the server will execute the callback and continue working on the original request
  
## Paired Programming

- Paired Programming commonly involves two roles. The Driver and the Navigator. The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard. The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not type. 

- Paired programming helps you with vocabulary Speaking, idea Reading, and writing code from scratch.

- Pair programming touches on all four skills: developers explain out loud what the code should do, listen to others’ guidance, read code that others have written, and write code themselves.

- when two people focus on the same code base, it is easier to catch mistakes

- Often times, the developers in a pairing have different skill sets. If one programmer is more experienced in a certain skill, they can teach a student who is less familiar with that area.
