### What google learned from its quest to build the perfect team

- analysing and improving individual workers is a practice known as "employee performance optimization"

- Havard business review found that the time spent by managers and employees in collaborative activities had ballooned by 50 percent over the last two decades

- Silicon Valley, software engineers are encouraged to work together, because studies show that groups tend to innovate faster

- It was almost impossible to find any evidence that the composition of a team made any difference. 

- No strong patterns for top performing groups

- Researchers concluded that what distinguished the good teams from the dysfunctional groups was how teammates treated one another

- good teams, members spoke in roughly the same proportion

- As long as everyone got a chance to talk, the team did well

- the good teams all were skilled at intuiting how others felt based on their tone of voice, their expressions and other nonverbal cues.



### How I explained Rest to my brother

- That first part tells the browser what protocol to use. That stuff you type in there is one of the most important breakthroughs in the history of computing.

-  REST provides a definition of a “resource”, which is what those things point to.
-  A web page is a “representation” of a resource. Resources are just concepts. URLs--those things that you type into the browser
-  Those URLs tell the browser that there's a concept somewhere. A browser can then go ask for a specific representation of the concept. Specifically, the browser asks for the web page representation of the concept.
- We need to be able to talk to all machines about all the stuff that's on all the other machines. So we need some way of having one machine tell another machine about a resource that might be on yet another machine.
- The URL, of course. If everything that machines need to talk about has a corresponding URL
- HTTP—this protocol Fielding and his friends created—is all about applying verbs to nouns. For instance, when you go to a web page, the browser does an HTTP GET on the URL you type in and back comes a web page.
