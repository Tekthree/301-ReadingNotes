### Introduction to React

### Thinking in React

- The first step is to break The UI into a Component Hierarchy
- 
- The first thing youâ€™ll want to do is to draw boxes around every component (and subcomponent) in the mock and give them all names.
- 
- One such technique is the single responsibility principle, that is, a component should ideally only do one thing.

- If it ends up growing, it should be decomposed into smaller subcomponents.

- Separate your UI into components, where each component matches one piece of your data model.
